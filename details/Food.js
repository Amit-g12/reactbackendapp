Labels like “gluten-free, organic, and “fat-free” are often assumed to mean healthy. But there are a lot of labels used on “health” foods that are very misleading.o matter what a food says on the front of the package, it is always important to turn it over and read the nutrition facts panel and the ingredients. Sometimes a product may seem like the smart choice, but then you find out it has too much added sugar, or it contains little or no nutrients, such as fiber or protein, that would actually provide health benefits.Diet or healthy foods may actually have more junk added in to replace ingredients taken out."

Because most fad diets eliminate carbs, they also remove fiber, which can cause problems including constipation, indigestion, fatigue, deficiencies in certain vitamins, and even poor immunity.While fiber has a lot of important health benefits, Tamayo notes that it's helpful for weight loss because it keeps you feeling full for longer, thereby preventing overeating. Aim to consume at least 21–25 grams of fiber daily if you're a woman and 30–38 grams if you're a man.Here are just a few high-fiber foods to consider adding to your diet: Berries Apples Broccoli  Brussels sprouts Bran flakes Brown rice Oatmeal Black beansLentils"

            "description": "​On paper, the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most protected ecosystems on the planet. There are thousands of protected areas, in addition to rules that safeguard forests on private lands.More importantly, big meatpacking companies that buy cattle — the largest driver of deforestation, by far, in the Amazon — committed more than a decade ago to only buy cattle from land without forest loss. This commitment was supposed to prevent any additional losses.Yet year after year, satellites that monitor changes in forest cover find the same thing: The Amazon is shrinking. Between August 1, 2018, and July 31, 2021, more than 34,000 square km (8.4 million acres) disappeared from the Brazilian Amazon. That’s an area larger than the entire nation of Belgium, and a 52 percent increase compared to the previous three years.It doesn’t add up. Assuming satellites don’t lie, someone is hiding deforestation.Over the last decade, scientists and environmental advocates have begun to uncover those missing hectares, and their research points to a concerning practice in the beef industry:cattle laundering."

In England, we have a celebration on 5th November called bonfire night, where we stand outside and burn things and have fireworks, Bryant explains. It's the perfect drink for that evening or any social evening outside in the autumn or wintertime. It's also great to make and put in a flask for New Years' fireworks standing outside in the cold! How good does that sound?This recipe mainly requires spices, so check your spice cabinet before heading to the store. You will need to get spiced rum, water, unsalted butter, an orange, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, and cinnamon sticks. The secret ingredient in this is the orange zest, which isn't normally found in buttered rum,Bryant shares. It adds a delicious orange zesty note, which pairs so well with the warming spice flavoring and takes the drink from good to great!"

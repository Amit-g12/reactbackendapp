It all started when the actress simply shared a picture of herself with a product from her haircare brand and she simply wrote: Something's coming. A few hours later, Jennifer Aniston's F.R.I.E.N.D.S co-star David Schwimmer hilariously recreated the picture with the product. Tagging the actress, he wrote: Jennifer Aniston - a towel I hope? Replying to which she wrote: Schwim? Trying to steal my thunder. The Internet, of course, could not keep calm after this Instagram exchange. You both are not on a break, wrote a fan, quoting a dialogue which has divided fans for a few decades and how. You guys! My heart, added another one. OH. MY. GOD, (it's ok if read in Janice's voice) read another comment."

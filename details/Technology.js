            "description": "SpaceX has revealed the official details of its Starlink satellite internet service for aviation, and it promises to deliver speeds of up to 350 Mbps for each airplane. Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian admitted earlier this year that the airline conducted exploratory tests of Starlink's internet technology for its planes. Hawaiian Airlines also announced that it will start deploying Starlink internet with select aircraft in 2023 around the same time. Shortly after that and after launching Starlink for RVs, the Federal Communications Commission authorized the company to provide satellite internet services to vehicles."

The 2023 Carrera T is a rear-wheel-drive coupe with a seven-speed manual gearbox, no rear seats, and lesser sound-deadening materials. Porsche also added thinner window glasses and a smaller battery to reduce the curb weight by 100 pounds. As a result, the Carrera T weighs 3,254 pounds and is the lightest Carrera to date. But if you want the eight-speed PDK and the rear seats, Porsche will install them at no cost.."

The Indian manufacturer has been gaining a lot of momentum this year, with sales figures in September 2022 reaching an impressive 82,097 units in the global market. This is a huge jump when compared to the 33,529 motorbikes sold in September 2021. Looking closer at the Indian market, Royal Enfield sold 73,646 units in September 2022, up from 21,233 units during the same period in 2021. As such, in the Indian market alone, the manufacturer has witnessed a growth of 170%. On the other hand, the number of motorbikes exported by Royal Enfield increased from 6,296 in September 2021 to 8,451 in September 2022. The brand's impressive sales figures are probably due to the recent launches of motorbikes like the Scram 411 and Hunter 350, which have received very good reviews since going on sale."

The flaw allows attackers to gain full administrator permissions and then perform any manner of malicious activity.Orca Security researcher Lidor Ben Shitrit found the bug and reported it to Microsoft, which released a partial fix for CVE-2022-35829 in its October Patch Tuesday. The vulnerability received a 6.4 CVSS score.There are two versions of Service Fabric Explorer. All new development focuses on version 2 (SFXv2), so Microsoft doesn't fix any holes in the older version, SFXv1, unless it's a critical bug. That means releases 8.1.316 and below remain vulnerable to exploitation. "

After explaining that Bethesda had its sights set on acquiring the Fallout franchise, Howard said: That original world always spoke to us. So when we thought about what we really, really wanted to do next, it was 'can you imagine if we got to do Fallout? No one's been doing it for a long time - is there any possibility?"

This one has a brown hue like a regular Coke Zero (I expected it to be purple), with a very sweet smell. When I took a sip of the Coke Byte, the fizziness was so strong that it reminded me of when I would eat Pop Rocks as a kid. Maybe that's what pixels taste like? The flavor was soft but still tasted like a Coke Zero. I could taste the sweetener used to replace the sugar... possibly Splenda? "

    "description": "Only an icy heart is unsentimental about the last summer tomato. Mine was a giant orange Brandywine that I let hang onto the vine far too long, and its destiny was a tomato tart.I’ve spent the summer making these tarts in every variation I could think of. Pie crust, puff pastry, different cheeses. They were ideal for every situation: a single or pair of friends coming over for dinner, a potluck, a barbecue, a beach picnic, or a housewarming gift."

    "description": "Using statistical modeling, researchers said that more daily steps were associated with a lower risk of mortality, as well as lower incident disease. Steps performed at a higher cadence may be associated with additional risk reduction, particularly for incident disease, the study noted.Every 2,000 steps showed that the risk for premature death could fall by 8%-11%.Limitations to the study include that the design of the study precludes the authors from making causal claims, that the step-count data was collected only once at the starting point of the study, that covariates were not measured at accelerometer-wear date, that some potential for reverse causation may still exist, that the UK Biobank had a very low response rate and participants were not representative of the overall UK population, that residual or unmeasured confounding may still be present and that the relative energy cost of walking and other daily activities is higher in older adults.

The standard keto diet is made up of 70% fat, 20% protein and 10% carbs"

    "description": "Rhonda Kalasho, a Los Angeles-based doctor of dental surgery and CEO of the TruGlo Modern Dental practice in Beverly Hills, told Fox News Digital that vinegar contains acetic acid, which has an acidity PH level of about 2 to 3. The reason why cavities develop on teeth is simply because the acidic environment created by the bacteria in the mouth breaks down carbohydrates and sugarsCarbonation or carbonated drinks actually are more acidic, so if you carbonate vinegar, you create even more of an acidic environment in the mouth when consuming it.This acidity weakens enamel making it a lot more prone to staining, tooth decay and breakage."

Researchers reportedly found that 7.8 million heart attack hospitalizations from 2018 were related to young adults between the ages of 18 and 44.Prediabetic young adults, who are defined as having blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, are 1.7 times more likely to be hospitalized for a heart attack compared to their non-prediabetic peers, according to the AHA’s research."
